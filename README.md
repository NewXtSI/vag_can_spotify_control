# Problem....
My Skoda Superb (2008) has Bluetooth Streaming to the cars multimedia system. But no chance to skip, pause, metadata display or something like this.

So I decided to build my own "controller" based on a ESP32 board with CAN access to get messages from the steering wheel remote and display the metadata.

First version is on a LiLyGo T-Display to check directly the car canbus communications.
